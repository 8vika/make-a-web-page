        <p>
          Essentially, the World Wide Web is a network that connects computers with servers.  The computers "talk" to servers by sending something called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests.

        <p>
          HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.  It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.

        <p>
          An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.  An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

          Unlike humans, computers follow instructions <i>exactly</i> as they are given.  So long as the syntax is correct computers will do precisely what they are told.  Humans, on the other hand, not so much.

          Inline elements format everything in a single line.  Examples are: br (break), em (emphasis), and img (image).  Box elements format the contents within an invisible textbox.  Examples are: p (paragraph) and div (divide).

        <p>
          The browser provides many useful tools for analyzing or creating a webpage.  For example, many of the attributes such as borders, color, font size, etc., can be changed interactively and the result can be viewed in real time.

        The "tree-like structure" of HTML
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
         HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are both languages where HTML controls the placement of content and CSS controls the style (decoration) of content.  Java script is used to control the interactive components on the page.  These languages are organized using something called DOM or Document Object Model into a hierarchical structure resembling a tree.

         The tree structure found in DOM hierarchy is viewed in text as nested indentations and viewed on the webpage as nested boxes.

         Although html code can be written in a word processor it is not recommended because there are many useful programming text editors that provide feedback in real time like Sublime, for example.

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> CSS allows a particular style to be applied to several different elements by assigning a class.  This saves time, space, and helps reduce coding errors by eliminating the need for repitition.  Another property called inheritance governs rules which eliminate the need for certain styles to be declared repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

        Why Udacity ROCKS!
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <b>I was "That guy":</b> Yes, I was "That guy!"  You know the one!  He's the guy old as dirt that has never done Facebook, Twitter, or even sent a text message with his phone.  Don't text and drive?  What's texting anyways?  My phone can surf the net?  No way!  Won't it short out or something if it gets wet? Yeah, I'm that guy! Then his boss says update your skills or start practicing saying "Welcome to Costco, I love you!"
        </p>
        <p>
            Then he signed up for Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.  He learned how to create accounts to online "stuff" like github.com.  He learned how to <span class="code">link</span> files together and <span class="code">look</span> at HTML code using developer tools.  He used to be SO ashamed that 6 year old's knew more about smart phones, webpages, and the internet than he did, but thanks to Udacity now he knows how to make a snazzy looking golly gee-wiz webpage.  How freagin' cool is that?  There's still a lot of stuff the old giezer doesn't understand, but with Udacity's help he'll get there!  And that is why Udacity ROCKS!
        </p>
        <p>
          No more nightmares saying, "Welcome to Costco, I love you!"
